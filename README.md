# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Chanry C.

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating something meaningful using Javascript, which is essentially a scripting language that allows the user to interact with webpages in more advanced ways. It is a year-long project that involves learning a "tool" that would ultimately assist one in the creation of their project.  The purpose of this blog is to guide you through my process in the creation of my website as well as the challenging obstacles I faced throughout.

## Content
For my project, I am making a platformer game that features a fun experience with enemy sprites for the user to pass through to enter the next level. Using the knowledge I acquired from in-class lessons and game ideas, I was able to create a platformer game with my partner Lingying. This blog will walk through my process of independently learning my tool KaboomJS and platformer games to make a platformer game with my partner. Not only that but also the blog will guide you through my journey to my product.

## Implications
In the present time, everything is surrounded by technology. A lot of things are digital, including forms of entertainment. Many people go on the internet to entertain themselves with games and movies. The game my partner and I made is a form of entertainment to cure boredom. The game allows an individual to play a friendly game that doesn't contain any violence. In addition, it would be a fun game for friends to compete on who collects the most coins, thus strengthening friendship. The game is a part of today's culture, in which many games are played digitally in our technologically advanced society. The negative impact of the game however may be that it would contribute to one's game addiction. Games are known to have negative impacts on kids' education and mindset, and our platformer game may add to the game addiction. It is also not so positive on the environment as the electricity that contributes to the powering of the game impacts the climate and increases climate change.
