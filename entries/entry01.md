## Deciding On My Tool 11/9/22

  Given a list of tools, I decided to go with [kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/). I felt that it would be most suitable for my project idea, which is a platformer game with multiple levels and obstacles. I tinkered much of kaboom on the [scenes demo](https://kaboomjs.com/play?demo=scenes) of the playground on its website. I took a peek at the code, and saw some symbols that seemed to represent the blocks on the map. I changed a couple of the symbols, and tried to find what code was making the symbols become the blocks on the map. I also looked at other demos like platformer, buttons, ai, and camera. Before settling on kaboom, I explored many other options as well as other project ideas. My initial project idea was an escape room, and my tool choice was [threejs](https://threejs.org/). Originally, I looked at the examples on the website, and thought that it was possible to make a escape room with threejs. As I went to tinker with threejs more, I came to realize that threejs was more for animation. I watched a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/6oFvqLfRnsU) on threejs, and I felt that threejs wasn't the tool to make an escape room game. My second choice was [babylonjs](https://www.babylonjs.com/), which is a 3D rendering engine. I watched a few videos on babylonjs, like [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFT5omp_F3g) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cib3Y64GVWE), following along with the video about cameras on [babylon playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/). I didn't end up choosing babylonjs because it seemed to be too complicated. All the tinkering with other tools 
  
  I'm currently in stage 1 and stage 2 of the Engineering Design Process, which is **defining the problem** and **researching the problem**. In my case, I defined what project idea I was going to settle with for the freedom project. For research, I researched possible tools that would help me with my project, and resulted with kaboom as my freedom project tool. 
  
  Skills that I have developed in this blog are *consideration* and *how to google*. My project idea had to serve some sort of purpose, and a platformer game would be a form of entertainment. I obtained the skill *how to google* by researching about all the tools and seeing if they would go well with my project idea. I watched videos and tinkered to form the conclusion of kaboom as my tool.
