## Overall Takeaways from Expo & Presentation 6/5/23

In this blog entry, I write about my takeaways from the SEP Expo and in-class presentations. My previous blog entries have been my process with learning my tool kaboomJS as well as my steps in creating the platformer game. With that came many challenges and obstacles that I was able to overcome through many ways. 

At the Expo, I presented my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5sjzSzh33M7WFdKRbCtdJZ2B6g0s9FB2f_MuTxbcFE/edit?usp=sharing) with my partner to the judges and all the people that came to explore the projects. I had gotten feedback from the judges to which I took into great consideration. My first takeaway from the expo was to elaborate more on the purpose of my project. I felt that I could've had a more significant purpose to my game rather than just for entertainment purposes. I think it also would've been nice to elaborate more on my challenges. I explained what was a challenge I faced, but not so much with my process of solving my challenges. Nevertheless, I did a good job in inviting judges and people to try my game.
