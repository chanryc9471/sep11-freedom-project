## Overall Takeaways from Expo & Presentation 6/5/23

In this blog entry, I write about my takeaways from the SEP Expo and in-class presentations. My previous blog entries have been my process with learning my tool kaboomJS as well as my steps in creating the platformer game. With that came many challenges and obstacles that I was able to overcome through many ways. 

At the Expo, I presented my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5sjzSzh33M7WFdKRbCtdJZ2B6g0s9FB2f_MuTxbcFE/edit?usp=sharing) with my partner to the judges and all the people that came to explore the projects. I had gotten feedback from the judges to which I took into great consideration. My first takeaway from the expo was to elaborate more on the purpose of my project. I felt that I could've had a more significant purpose to my game rather than just for entertainment purposes. I think it also would've been nice to elaborate more on my challenges. I explained what was a challenge I faced, but not so much with my process of solving my challenges. My last takeaway for the expo was to have instructions on the website so that the users would know the controls. During the expo, my partner and I had to explain the sprite controls many times because they were confused on whether it was the wasd keys or the arrow keys that moved the sprites. We noticed that an instructions page would have been helpful in saving us time in having to explain the key controls.

As for my [in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cO_I9Zzre5fE-AhSlaupsr6-GLH3dpxiGZiAefURTfc/edit?usp=sharing), a takeaway that I've gotten was to explain more on my product. I didn't take enough time to explain my product and all the components. In my perspective, I knew how the game worked, but my classmates didn't so it might've been unclear for them. Nevertheless, my partner and I did a good job explaining our process in making our product, including our challenges and takeaways. We showed code snippets along with detailed explanations of how we came to ovecome the obstacles.
